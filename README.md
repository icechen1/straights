The rules of the games are simple, the player with the 7 of Spades start the game and each successive player play a card of adjacent rank and same suit, or any seven of any suit. Otherwise, the player must discard a card. At the end of the round when all cards are played, the discards are summed up, and a new round starts until one player reaches more than 60 total points. Then, the player with the lowest score wins.
