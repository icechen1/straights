=== Visual Display of Hand moves ===
Using GTK CSS styling and opacity changes, we color the buttons of the cards in the hands of the player accordingly.
If it is red, the move is a discard. If a card is green, it is a valid play. If a card is semi-transparent and red
then it is an invalid move and clicking it would result in an error popup.

Additionally, in order to better visualize computer moves, we added a delay using c++ timeouts, so each computer player will
take a bit of time to play its move.

This feature is shown on all games, for computer and human players.

=== Game history ===
There is a collapsable widget at the bottom of the main game window (Game History). Clicking it will 
expand a text field with a move by move history of the current game. The output is similar to the output of the game
from project part 1.

It is implemented using a string stream that stores every action in the game, and it is then printed to the GTKLabel
containing the game history.

This feature is shown on all games.

=== Glade GUI ===
Instead of building the GUI from the code, we implemented our entire game using glade's interface designer (screen.glade and mainmenu.glade).
This makes the GUI easier to maintain and to reason with, and each screen is stored in an xml file (.glade) and loaded upon opening the game program.
